= Summary

PyMOL commands offer precise control over the visualization of molecular models, making PyMOL a favored tool for creating images of protein structures for publications and presentations. However, many users struggle to remember these commands due to infrequent use, complicating writing new scripts. 
One practical approach to address this issue is using code fragments as templates for different parts of the task. 
These fragments can be accessed from a library while coding in text editors like Visual Studio Code, Vim, and Emacs.

To facilitate this, we developed a library of PyMOL code templates, known as pymolsnips, which simplifies the process of writing PyMOL scripts. 
Pymolsnips is available on GitHub in formats compatible with 18 popular text editors, supporting Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. 
The GitHub repository also includes animations to guide users through the installation process for each text editor. 
This library will significantly enhance the productivity of PyMOL users when scripting.

= Context in Molecular Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction
Tools like PyMOL and libraries like pymolsnips play a crucial role in the broader context of molecular graphics and human-computer interaction. 
Molecular graphics software allows scientists to visualize complex molecular structures, aiding in the understanding and communicating biochemical processes. 
The ability to precisely control these visualizations is essential for producing high-quality images for research and educational purposes.

Human-computer interaction (HCI) principles are integral to the design of these tools, ensuring they are user-friendly and accessible. 
By providing code snippets and templates, pymolsnips enhances the usability of PyMOL, making it easier for users to create and modify scripts without needing to recall specific commands. 
This approach aligns with HCI goals of improving efficiency and reducing cognitive load, ultimately fostering a more productive and intuitive user experience.
